Changes from v0.4c:
-------------------

*) Added mouse hovering help. This idea was suggested by [Victor Goff](http://vgoff.blogspot.com/). Thanks!


Changes from v0.4b:
-------------------

*) DRY: Changed formatter.rb so only one version of the function form is needed. See comment for usage.

*) Made the main CWoS window 155px wide and non-resizable which IMHO looks better.

*) Replaced global variable $txt by instance variable @txt.

*) Changed first button to toggle between 'Ruby/Text' instead of 'on/off' to make it clearer.

*) Updated copyright notice and reformatted it a bit.

*) Updated contributor information - vhgiii
